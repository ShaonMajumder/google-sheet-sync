    SPREADSHEET_ID=your_spreadsheet_id
    ```
    Replace your_credential_file.json and your_spreadsheet_id with actual Data.
2. **Script Example**:

    Use the GoogleSheetsCRUD class to perform operations on your Google Sheet. Below is an example script demonstrating how to use the package:

    ```sh
    from google_sheets_sync import GoogleSheetsCRUD

    def main():
        # Initialize the CRUD class
        sheets_crud = GoogleSheetsCRUD()

        # Read data from the sheet
        print("Reading data...")
        data = sheets_crud.readSheet("testsheet")
        print("Current data in the sheet:")
        for row in data:
            print(row)

        # Append a new row
        print("\nAppending a new row...")
        append_response = sheets_crud.appendRow(["New", "Data"], "testsheet")
        print(f"Append response: {append_response}")

        # Prepend a new row
        print("\nPrepending a new row...")
        prepend_response = sheets_crud.prependRow(["Prepended", "Data"], "testsheet")
        print(f"Prepend response: {prepend_response}")

        # Update a specific row
        print("\nUpdating row 2...")
        update_response = sheets_crud.updateRow(2, ["Updated", "Data"], "testsheet")
        print(f"Update response: {update_response}")

        # Delete a specific row
        print("\nDeleting row 3...")
        sheets_crud.deleteRow(3, "testsheet")

        # Delete and shift rows up
        print("\nDeleting row 2 and shifting rows up...")
        sheets_crud.deleteRowAndShiftUp(2, "testsheet")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

3. **Running the Script**:
